# Dual Riesel Project

This project aims to solve the Dual Riesel Conjecture.

## What is the Dual Riesel Conjecture?

The Dual Riesel Conjecture states that 509203 is the smallest value $$ k $$ such that $$ 2^n - k $$ will never be prime.
Note that $$ 2^n - k $$ can be negative, meaning that it is possible for $$ \left|2^n - k\right| $$ to be a prime number. However, we only search for positive primes, since proving the conjecture for positive primes will prove it for all primes, and there are only a finite number of primes of this form for the remaining $$ k $$.

## How can I help search?

_This project is currently a work in progress, so there is no current finished program to search for Dual Riesel primes._

## I would like more information about the project, conjecture, search, etc.

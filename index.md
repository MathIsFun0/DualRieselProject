# Dual Riesel Project

This project aims to solve the Dual Riesel Conjecture.

## What is the Dual Riesel Conjecture?

The Dual Riesel Conjecture states that 509203 is the smallest value 'k' such that 2^n - k will never be prime.
Note that 2^n - k can be negative, meaning that it is possible for |2^n - k| to be a prime number. However, we only search for positive primes, since proving the conjecture for positive primes will prove it for all primes.

## How can I help search?

_Info will be put in soon, as the project is a work in progress._

## I would like more information about the project, conjecture, search, etc.

  You can find more information on our [faq page](https://mathisfun0.github.io/DualRieselProject/faq), [history page](https://mathisfun0.github.io/DualRieselProject/history), or our [progress page](https://mathisfun0.github.io/DualRieselProject/progress).

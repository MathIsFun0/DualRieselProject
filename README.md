# Dual Riesel Project Results

## Before the main program was created:

`R2_1-39_primes.txt` contains all of the primes that were found and proven prime with PFGW (exponents between 1 and 39)

`R2_40-661_primes.txt` contains all of the primes that were found with PFGW and proven prime with Primo (exponents between 40 and 661)

`R2_662-81000_PRPs.txt` contains all of the smaller PRPs that were found with PFGW (exponents between 662 and 81,000)

`R2 > 81K.txt` contains all of the larger PRPs that were found with PFGW (exponents between 81,000 and 400,000), as well as PRPs that were reported to [PRP Top](http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/prptop.php) by others.

## So how can I find more primes?

Currently, a program is in development for searching for these kinds of primes using cutting-edge sieving and probable prime testing programs. (All of the previous primes and probable primes will be double-checked first.) However, these numbers are considered probable primes, meaning that although they are almost certainly prime, there is an extremely small chance that they are composite.

To show that the probable primes are actually prime, programs like Primo and fastECPP, which use much slower algorithms, must be used.
